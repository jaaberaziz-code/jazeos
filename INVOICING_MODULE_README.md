## Technical Details

### Data Format

**Money Values:**
- All amounts stored as integers in cents
- Example: $100.00 = 10000 cents
- Ensures precision, no floating-point errors

**Percentages:**
- Stored as basis points (integer)
- 100 basis points = 1%
- Example: 20% = 2000 basis points

**Invoice Numbers:**
- Format: `PREFIX-YEAR-SEQUENCE`
- Example: `INV-2026-000001`
- Unique per user, year, and scope
- Sequential numbering with gap tolerance

**Credit Note Numbers:**
- Format: `PREFIX-YEAR-SEQUENCE`
- Example: `CN-2026-000001`
- Separate sequence from invoices

### Tax Calculations

**Tax Exclusive:**
```
Line Total = Quantity × Unit Price
Tax Amount = Line Total × Tax Rate
Final Total = Line Total + Tax Amount
```

**Tax Inclusive:**
```
Line Total = Quantity × Unit Price
Tax Amount = Line Total × (Tax Rate / (1 + Tax Rate))
Pre-Tax Amount = Line Total - Tax Amount
```

### Discount Calculations

**Percentage Discount:**
```
Discount Amount = Line Total × (Discount Value / 10000)
```

**Fixed Amount Discount:**
```
Discount Amount = min(Discount Value, Line Total)
```

### Invoice Total Calculation

```
Subtotal = Sum of (Quantity × Unit Price) for all items
Discount Total = Sum of discount amounts for all items
Tax Total = Sum of tax amounts for all items
Total = Subtotal - Discount Total + Tax Total
Amount Due = Total - Amount Paid
```

## Security & Authorization

All invoicing operations require authentication and authorization:

- Users can only access their own data
- All queries filtered by `user_id`
- Controllers verify ownership before actions
- Related records validated (customer, invoice, etc.)
- Cascade deletions respect relationships
- Cannot delete tax rates/discounts in use

## Best Practices

### Creating Invoices

1. ✅ Set up customers before creating invoices
2. ✅ Configure tax rates and discounts beforehand
3. ✅ Use clear, descriptive line item descriptions
4. ✅ Review totals before issuing
5. ✅ Issue invoices only when ready to send
6. ❌ Don't delete draft invoices, use them as templates

### Recording Payments

1. ✅ Enter exact amounts received
2. ✅ Include payment reference numbers
3. ✅ Use appropriate payment methods
4. ✅ Record payments on the date received
5. ❌ Don't record payments in advance

### Managing Tax Rates

1. ✅ Create tax rates before they're needed
2. ✅ Use descriptive names (e.g., "CA Sales Tax 7.5%")
3. ✅ Set validity dates for time-limited rates
4. ✅ Deactivate instead of deleting
5. ❌ Don't modify rates affecting existing invoices

### Using Discounts

1. ✅ Set redemption limits to control usage
2. ✅ Use validity dates for promotions
3. ✅ Choose descriptive codes
4. ✅ Deactivate expired discounts
5. ❌ Don't delete discounts with history

## Troubleshooting

### Invoice Won't Issue

**Problem**: "Issue Invoice" button disabled
**Solution**:
- Ensure invoice has at least one line item
- Verify invoice total is greater than 0
- Check that invoice is in "Draft" status

### Cannot Delete Customer

**Problem**: "Cannot delete customer with existing invoices"
**Solution**:
- Customers with invoices cannot be deleted
- This prevents data integrity issues
- Archive or mark customer as inactive instead

### Cannot Delete Tax Rate/Discount

**Problem**: "Cannot delete tax rate/discount in use"
**Solution**:
- Tax rates and discounts used in invoices cannot be deleted
- Mark as inactive instead
- Set end date to prevent future use

### Payment Amount Validation

**Problem**: "Payment amount cannot exceed amount due"
**Solution**:
- Check invoice's amount_due
- Enter amount in cents, not dollars
- For overpayment, create credit note for excess
