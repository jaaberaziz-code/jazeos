# Cycle Menu Fitness Plan Module — Planning Document

Last updated: 2025-11-07
Owner: Davor Minchorov
Status: Draft for implementation

## 1. Objective & Scope

- **Objective**: Provide a comprehensive meal planning and fitness tracking system that supports cyclical nutrition and workout programs aligned with fitness goals (cutting, bulking, maintenance, recomposition).
- **Success metrics**:
  - 90% of planned meals and workouts logged within 24 hours
  - Caloric adherence within ±5% of daily targets over 7-day rolling average
  - Body composition progress photos captured at least weekly
  - <3 min average time to log a meal or workout
- **In-scope**:
  - Cyclical nutrition plans with macronutrient targets that vary by training/rest days
  - Meal planning with recipes, ingredients, portions, and nutrition tracking
  - Workout program templates and session logging (exercises, sets, reps, weight, RPE)
  - Progress tracking: body weight, measurements, photos, performance metrics
  - Meal prep scheduling and shopping list generation
  - Adherence analytics and goal progress visualization
  - Template library for common meals and workout routines
  - API endpoints and mobile-friendly UI
- **Out-of-scope (v1)**:
  - AI meal generation or automated macro calculations (manual entry/templates)
  - Integration with fitness trackers (Apple Health, Fitbit) — phase 2
  - Social features, meal/workout sharing — phase 2
  - Advanced periodization models (DUP, block periodization) — v1 focuses on linear

## 2. Architecture Principles (Laravel 12)

- Use Eloquent models with proper relationships; avoid DB:: facade for domain logic
- Validation via Form Requests with custom error messages
- Authorization via policies for all CRUD operations
- Queue jobs for meal prep reminders, progress photo notifications, weekly digests
- Domain events for tracking adherence, milestone achievements, cycle phase transitions
- Service layer for complex calculations (macros, TDEE, progressive overload recommendations)
- Follow project conventions for casts, enums, and factories

## 3. Domain Model

## 4. Workflows

### Nutrition Workflow:
1. Create FitnessPlan with goal and targets
2. Set up NutritionCycle with cyclical macro targets
3. Create DailyTemplates for each day type (training/rest)
4. Build Recipe library with ingredients and macros
5. Assign TemplateMeals to DailyTemplates
6. Daily: Log meals against templates or create custom entries
7. Weekly: Review adherence analytics and adjust as needed

### Workout Workflow:
1. Create or select WorkoutProgram template
2. Define WorkoutTemplates for each training day
3. Add TemplateExercises with prescribed volume
4. Daily: Start workout session, log sets/reps/weight
5. Track progressive overload via performance charts
6. Deload weeks automatically suggested based on fatigue markers

### Progress Tracking Workflow:
1. Weekly check-ins: Create ProgressEntry
2. Log weight, measurements, photos (front/side/back)
3. View progress charts: weight trend, measurement changes
4. Milestone achievements trigger notifications
5. Adjust nutrition/training based on progress rate

### Meal Prep Workflow:
1. Select recipes for the week
2. Generate shopping list with aggregated ingredients
3. Create MealPrepSchedule with batch quantities
4. Mark prep tasks completed
5. Log meals from prepped inventory

## 5. Calculations & Business Rules

### Macro Calculations:
- TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier
- BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor): Men: 10×weight(kg) + 6.25×height(cm) - 5×age + 5
- Caloric surplus (bulk): TDEE + 300-500 cal
- Caloric deficit (cut): TDEE - 500-750 cal
- Protein: 2.0-2.5g per kg bodyweight
- Fat: 20-30% of total calories
- Carbs: remaining calories ÷ 4

### Progressive Overload:
- Increase weight when RPE ≤ 7 for 2 consecutive sessions
- Increase reps when target reps achieved for 2 sessions at RPE ≤ 8
- Suggest deload when average RPE > 8.5 for 3+ sessions

### Adherence Scoring:
- Daily adherence: actual macros within ±10% of targets = 100%
- Weekly adherence: average of daily scores
- Workout adherence: completed sessions / planned sessions × 100

## 6. Permissions & Security

- **Roles**: owner only (personal app; future multi-user would add coach/client)
- **Policies**: view/create/update/delete for all entities
- **PII**: Progress photos private; body metrics sensitive
- **Data retention**: Progress photos kept indefinitely unless manually deleted; meal/workout logs kept 2+ years

## 7. UI/UX Plan

**Pagination, filtering, sorting**: Standard patterns; rate limits via middleware

## 12. Migrations, Factories, Seeders

### Migrations:
- Create migrations for all 20+ entities with proper foreign keys and indexes
- Include all attributes when modifying columns (Laravel 12 requirement)
- Use JSON columns for flexible fields (muscle_groups, day_type_mapping)
- Add unique constraints (e.g., unique recipe names per user)

### Factories:
- FitnessPlan::factory()->cutting() / ->bulking() / ->maintenance()
- Recipe::factory()->highProtein() / ->mealPrepFriendly() / ->withIngredients(5)
- WorkoutProgram::factory()->ppl() / ->upperLower() / ->fullBody()
- Exercise::factory()->compound() / ->isolation() / ->cardio()
- ProgressEntry::factory()->withPhotos() / ->withMeasurements()

### Seeders:
- Demo FitnessPlan with complete 12-week program
- Recipe library (50+ common fitness meals)
- Exercise library (200+ exercises with all major movements)
- Sample meal logs and workout logs for 30 days
- Progress entries showing realistic transformation timeline

## 13. Validation & Controllers

### Form Requests:
- StoreRecipeRequest: name required, macros numeric, servings min:1
- StoreMealLogRequest: logged_at required, macros validate sum
- StoreWorkoutLogRequest: reps min:1 max:100, weight min:0, rpe between:1,10
- StoreProgressEntryRequest: weight required, measurements optional array

### Controllers:
- Thin controllers; delegate to services:
  - MacroCalculationService: TDEE, daily targets, adjustments
  - AdherenceService: scoring, streak calculation
  - ProgressiveOverloadService: weight/rep recommendations
  - MealPrepService: shopping list generation
- Use API Resources for serialization
- Eager load relationships to prevent N+1:
  - Recipe with ingredients
  - WorkoutSession with logs and exercises
  - ProgressEntry with measurements and photos

## 14. Testing Strategy

### Feature Tests:
- Complete nutrition cycle workflow (create plan → log meals → view adherence)
- Workout session logging with progressive overload
- Progress tracking with photo uploads
- Meal prep scheduling and shopping list generation
- API endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Authentication and authorization for all routes

### Unit Tests:
- MacroCalculationService: TDEE, macro splits, various formulas
- AdherenceService: scoring edge cases, streak logic
- ProgressiveOverloadService: recommendation accuracy
- NutritionCycle day type mapping logic
- Recipe macro calculations from ingredients

### Edge Cases:
- Zero-calorie meals (water, black coffee)
- Missing workout logs (partial sessions)
- Progress entries without photos
- Recipe scaling with decimal servings
- Negative weight progression (strength loss)

### Performance:
- Meal log queries with 365+ days of data
- Exercise library search with 500+ exercises
- Progress photo gallery with 52+ photos
- Analytics dashboard aggregations

## 15. Events & Listeners

### Domain Events:

## 16. Configuration

**Config file**: fitness.php
```php
return [
    'tdee_activity_multipliers' => [
        'sedentary' => 1.2,
        'lightly_active' => 1.375,
        'moderately_active' => 1.55,
        'very_active' => 1.725,
        'extra_active' => 1.9,
    ],
    'macro_adherence_threshold_percent' => 10,
    'deload_week_frequency' => 4, // every 4 weeks
    'progress_photo_reminder_day' => 'sunday',
    'meal_prep_reminder_time' => '10:00',
    'workout_reminder_minutes_before' => 30,
    'adherence_streak_milestones' => [7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365],
];
```

## 17. Risks & Mitigations

- **Inaccurate nutrition data** → Validate against USDA database; allow user corrections
- **User burnout from logging** → Quick-log shortcuts, voice input, template reuse
- **Progress plateaus** → Automated recommendations for diet/training adjustments
- **Data loss** → Regular automated backups; export functionality
- **Injury from poor form** → Include form cues, video demos, RPE guidance
- **Body image concerns** → Positive language, focus on performance, optional photo feature

## 18. Milestones & Timeline (indicative)

- **M1 (Week 1)**: Migrations, models, factories for nutrition domain; recipe CRUD
- **M2 (Week 2)**: Meal logging, daily macro tracking, adherence calculations
- **M3 (Week 3)**: Workout program models, exercise library, session logging
- **M4 (Week 4)**: Progress tracking, photos, measurements, weight trends
- **M5 (Week 5)**: Template system, meal prep scheduling, shopping lists

## 20. Open Questions

- Should we support multiple fitness plans simultaneously or force one active plan?
- Which body composition formula should be default (Navy method, Jackson-Pollock, DEXA estimates)?
- Do we need barcode scanning for v1 or defer to v2?
- Should progress photos require specific poses or be freeform?
- Integration preferences for future fitness tracker sync?
- Should we include supplement tracking (protein shakes, creatine, etc.)?

## 21. Data Privacy & Ethics

- Progress photos stored securely with restricted access
- Option to disable progress photo feature entirely
- Body metrics presented neutrally without judgment
- Focus on health and performance over aesthetics
- Clear data deletion options
- No social comparison or public sharing in v1

## 22. Observability

- Structured logging for macro calculations, adherence scoring, and recommendations
- Metrics: daily active users, meals logged per day, workouts completed per week, average adherence %, API response times
- Alerts: high API error rates, failed notification sends, large data exports

## 23. Next Steps

1. Review and confirm scope with stakeholder (Davor)
2. Create feature branch: `feature/cycle-menu-fitness-plan`
3. Start with M1: migrations and models for nutrition domain
4. Build Recipe and Ingredient CRUD with comprehensive factories
5. Implement MacroCalculationService with unit tests
6. Progressive implementation following milestone timeline
7. Regular demos at end of each milestone for feedback

---

This document defines the v1 scope for the Cycle Menu Fitness Plan module. Implementation should follow Laravel 12 best practices with proper testing, validation, and API resource patterns. The module integrates seamlessly into the JazeOS personal management platform.

## 24. Cycle Menu MVP — Implementation Plan (Focused Scope)

Status: Approved plan; ready to implement

### 24.1 Scope Summary
- Add a new navigation entry for Cycle Menu (or reorganize under Nutrition if preferred).
- Support multiple items per day within a cycle menu.
- Send a daily notification at 09:00 about today’s menu.

Assumptions (pending future iteration if needed):
- Items can be free‑text with an optional link to `Recipe` if available.
- Use application timezone for 09:00 notifications initially; per‑user timezones can be added later.
- In‑app notifications enabled; email optional if mail is configured.

### 24.2 Information Architecture & Navigation
- Add primary or secondary navigation entry labeled “Cycle Menu”.
- Use named route helpers for URL generation and active state highlighting.
- Follow Tailwind v4 and existing dark mode conventions defined in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

### 24.3 Data Model & Migrations (Laravel 12)
- Tables:
  - `cycle_menus`: id, name, starts_on (date), cycle_length_days (int), is_active (bool), notes, timestamps.
  - `cycle_menu_days`: id, cycle_menu_id (FK), day_index (int), notes, unique([cycle_menu_id, day_index]), timestamps.
  - `cycle_menu_items`: id, cycle_menu_day_id (FK), title, meal_type (enum: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, other), time_of_day (time nullable), quantity (string), recipe_id (FK nullable), position (int), timestamps.
- Indexes and foreign keys for all relationships. Defer soft deletes unless needed.
- Factories for each model for testing and seed data.

### 24.4 Eloquent Models & Relationships
- `CycleMenu` hasMany `CycleMenuDay`; scope `active()`.
- `CycleMenuDay` belongsTo `CycleMenu`; hasMany `CycleMenuItem` (ordered by `position`).
- `CycleMenuItem` belongsTo `CycleMenuDay`; optional belongsTo `Recipe`.
- Use `casts()` methods per project conventions.

### 24.5 Authorization & Validation
- Policies for CRUD (owner‑only) on CycleMenu, Day, and Item.
- Form Requests for store/update on all three resources; include custom error messages.

### 24.6 Controllers & Routes
- `CycleMenuController`: index, create, store, show, edit, update, destroy.
- `CycleMenuDayController`: edit/update and reordering endpoint.
- `CycleMenuItemController`: store, update, destroy, reorder.
- Define named routes in `routes/web.php`; add API routes later if needed.

### 24.7 Views (Blade + Tailwind v4)
- Index: list of cycle menus, active badge, quick actions.
- Show: grid (e.g., 7‑day) with per‑day columns showing multiple items and supporting drag/drop ordering.
- Edit Day modal: repeatable item fields; maintain `position` for ordering.
- Ensure accessibility and dark mode support per `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

### 24.8 Daily 09:00 Notification
- Notification class `DailyMenuNotification` (in‑app; mail optional) implements `ShouldQueue`.
- Scheduler in `bootstrap/app.php`: `dailyAt('09:00')` using app timezone.
- Logic: For active CycleMenu(s), compute today’s `day_index` from `starts_on` and `cycle_length_days`; eager load items and notify the user with today’s list.

### 24.9 Tests (Pest/Feature)
- Factories and relationship tests for the three models.
- Feature tests: create menu with multiple items per day; reorder items; view today’s items.
- Notification test: scheduler dispatches `DailyMenuNotification` at 09:00; assert queued.

### 24.10 Seeders & Demo Data
- Demo Cycle Menu: 7 days with several items per day.
- Update `DatabaseSeeder` to conditionally seed demo data in non‑production.

### 24.11 Performance & N+1
- Eager load `days.items` for index/show.
- Proper indexes on FKs; batch queries in the scheduler to avoid per‑day loops.

### 24.12 Rollout Steps
1) Generate migrations, models, factories, policies, and form requests via `php artisan make:` with `--no-interaction`.
2) Implement controllers, routes, and views.
3) Implement the notification and scheduler.
4) Write feature and unit tests; run and fix.
5) Seed demo data; verify UX.
6) Run Pint (`vendor/bin/pint`).
7) Update README with usage instructions.

### 24.13 Timeline
- Day 1: Data model, migrations, models, factories.
- Day 2: Controllers, validation, routes, initial views, navigation update.
- Day 3: Notifications + scheduler, tests, polish.
- Day 4: QA, docs, demo.
