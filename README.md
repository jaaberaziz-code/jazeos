2. Open the Cycle Menu from the top navigation.
3. Create a menu (name, start date, cycle length, active toggle). Days 0..(length‑1) are auto‑created.
4. Open a menu to add items to each day, set types/times/quantities, and reorder by position.

Notifications:
- Scheduler entry `cycle-menu-daily-notify` runs the command `cycle-menus:notify-today --dispatch-job` daily at 09:00.
- Manually trigger:
  - Dry run (no notifications sent): `php artisan cycle-menus:notify-today --dry-run`
  - Dispatch to queue: `php artisan cycle-menus:notify-today --dispatch-job`
  - Run immediately: `php artisan cycle-menus:notify-today`
- In‑app notifications include a link back to the menu.
