## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Design Patterns:**
- Service Layer Pattern for business logic
- Repository Pattern via Eloquent ORM
- Form Request Validation
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Enum-based Type Safety

**Data Integrity:**
- Money stored as integers (cents) for precision
- Basis points for percentages (10000 = 100%)
- Atomic sequence generation with database locking
- User data isolation with authorization checks
- Cascade deletions and foreign key constraints

**Frontend Stack:**
- Laravel Blade templates
- Alpine.js for interactivity
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- Dark mode support throughout
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

### Database Schema

**10 Tables Created:**
1. `customers` - Customer profiles and billing info
2. `invoices` - Invoice headers with totals
3. `invoice_items` - Line items with tax/discount
4. `payments` - Payment records
5. `credit_notes` - Credit note headers
6. `credit_note_applications` - Credit applications to invoices
7. `refunds` - Refund records
8. `tax_rates` - Tax rate definitions
9. `discounts` - Discount code definitions
10. `sequences` - Atomic number generation

**Relationships:**
- Customer → hasMany → Invoices
- Customer → hasMany → CreditNotes
- Invoice → hasMany → InvoiceItems
- Invoice → hasMany → Payments
- Invoice → belongsTo → Customer
- InvoiceItem → belongsTo → TaxRate
- InvoiceItem → belongsTo → Discount
- CreditNote → hasMany → Applications

### Key Features

**Security:**
- ✅ User isolation (all queries filtered by user_id)
- ✅ Authorization checks on all operations
- ✅ CSRF protection on all forms
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Eloquent
- ✅ XSS protection via Blade escaping

**Data Precision:**
- ✅ Money as integers (no floating-point errors)

- ✅ Atomic sequence generation (no gaps in normal operation)
- ✅ Transaction support for critical operations

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Real-time calculations
- ✅ Inline form validation
- ✅ Success/error flash messages
- ✅ Empty states with helpful CTAs
- ✅ Loading states and confirmations

**Business Logic:**
