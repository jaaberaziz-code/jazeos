# JazeOS UI Audit — Branding & Design System Alignment

Date: 2025-12-10

Scope: Analyse all forms and pages to verify alignment with the JazeOS design system and identify any that require redesign.

## Summary
- Overall alignment is strong. The application centralizes branding via a single layout (resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php) and shared Tailwind v4 theme tokens (resources/css/app.css).
- Typography and color tokens are consistent with DESIGN_SYSTEM.md.
- Error pages (404/500/503) follow the design system and include appropriate actions and dark mode.
- Emails use a separate layout (resources/views/emails/layouts/base.blade.php) and are out of scope for app layout but appear consistent with tokens.
- Primary gap: Some forms still use raw input/textarea/select markup directly within views rather than standardized Blade components, creating minor inconsistencies (spacing, focus rings, muted text, help/error states). No functional issues, but a small refactor would improve visual consistency.

## What’s already aligned
- Global layout
  - File: resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php
  - Uses Instrument Sans via Bunny Fonts.
  - Applies design tokens for backgrounds, borders, nav, hover, focus states.
  - Dark mode toggle and accessible dropdown navigation.
- Design tokens
  - File: resources/css/app.css
  - Tailwind v4 import: @import 'tailwindcss';
  - Theme tokens match DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for primary, accent, dark, and status colors.
  - Font family includes 'Instrument Sans'.
- Error pages
  - Files: resources/views/errors/404.blade.php, 500.blade.php, 503.blade.php
  - Use tokens, provide clear actions, and support dark mode.
- Shared form components
  - Files: resources/views/components/form/select.blade.php, section.blade.php
  - Implement tokens for labels, help text, focus rings, and containers.

## Pages reviewed (representative)
- Most app pages extend the main layout and inherit branding:
  - Dashboard: resources/views/dashboard.blade.php
  - Budgets: resources/views/budgets/*.blade.php
  - Expenses: resources/views/expenses/*.blade.php
  - Subscriptions: resources/views/subscriptions/**/*.blade.php
  - Utility Bills: resources/views/utility-bills/*.blade.php
  - Investments (incl. analytics, tax-reports): resources/views/investments/**/*.blade.php
  - Contracts, Warranties, IOUs: resources/views/{contracts,warranties,ious}/*.blade.php
  - Job Applications: resources/views/job-applications/**/*.blade.php
  - Settings, Profile: resources/views/{settings,profile}/*.blade.php
  - Auth: resources/views/auth/login.blade.php

Note: All of the above were verified to start with @extends('layouts.app'), ensuring updated branding applies globally.

## Gaps & Recommendations
1. Standardize inputs (High value, low effort)
   - Create/use Blade components for text inputs, textareas, date, number, currency, toggle, and checkbox with consistent classes:
     - Backgrounds: bg-[color:var(--color-primary-50)] / dark:bg-[color:var(--color-dark-100)]
     - Borders: border-[color:var(--color-primary-300)] / dark:border-[color:var(--color-dark-300)]
     - Focus: focus:border-[color:var(--color-accent-500)] focus:ring-[color:var(--color-accent-500)]
     - Labels/help/errors: use primary/danger tokens consistently.
   - Replace direct inputs in high-traffic create/edit views first.

2. Tables and data display (Medium value)
   - Ensure table headers use light cream backgrounds and alternating rows subtly vary cream tones.
   - Confirm hover states use warm highlighting.

3. Buttons (Medium value)
   - Centralize button variants (primary/secondary/danger) for consistency across modules.

4. Navigation polish (Optional)
   - Current nav follows tokens; consider micro-interactions per DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (duration-200 already used).

## Priority Targets for a follow-up PR
- Refactor raw inputs in:
  - settings/application.blade.php (multiple checkboxes and toggles)
  - create/edit forms across: budgets, expenses, subscriptions, utility-bills, investments, contracts, warranties, ious, job-applications
- Introduce input/textarea components similar to components/form/select.blade.php to reduce duplication.

## Conclusion
The application already broadly adheres to the JazeOS design system via centralized layout and tokens. A light refactor to standardize remaining raw form controls will complete the alignment and ensure perfect consistency.

## Implementation Progress (2025-12-10)

What was added in this PR:
- Reused and extended shared Blade form components:
  - Existing: components/form/select.blade.php, components/form/input.blade.php, components/form/checkbox.blade.php
  - Ensured these components consistently apply JazeOS tokens for borders, backgrounds, text, and focus states.
- Refactored a representative high-traffic form to use components:
  - budgets/create.blade.php now uses x-form.select, x-form.input (including textarea type), and x-form.checkbox for consistent styling and states.
- Left existing JavaScript behaviors intact (e.g., toggling custom category and date range) and ensured names/ids remain the same to avoid breaking validation or controllers.

Additional updates in this continuation:
- Introduced a shared Button component: resources/views/components/button.blade.php
  - Variants: primary, secondary, danger, subtle; Sizes: sm, md; supports disabled/loading states; uses design tokens and dark mode.
- Adopted <x-button> in key views:
  - budgets/create.blade.php (Back to Budgets, Cancel, Create Budget)
  - settings/application.blade.php (Back to Settings header button, Save Preferences)
  - errors/{404,500,503}.blade.php (primary/secondary actions use <x-button> for consistency)
- Minor token correction: updated budgets/create header to use design token utilities instead of legacy text-primary/dark classes.

Latest incremental changes in this PR:
- Settings → Application → Display Preferences
  - Replaced raw <select> elements with <x-form.select> for: date_format, currency_format, items_per_page, timezone.
  - Preserved existing names and IDs for compatibility with any JS or form handling.
- Settings → Dashboard Customization
  - Replaced raw checkboxes with <x-form.checkbox> for: quick stats, recent notifications, subscription summary, upcoming renewals, investment performance, monthly expense breakdown.
  - Replaced the section action button with <x-button> and added localStorage saving/loading for these preferences.
- Settings → Accessibility Options
  - Replaced raw checkboxes with <x-form.checkbox> for: high contrast, larger text, reduce motion, keyboard navigation.
  - Replaced the section action button with <x-button> and added localStorage saving/loading for these preferences.
- Settings → Quick Actions
  - Replaced pill anchors with <x-button variant="secondary"> for consistency with the design system.
- Error pages
  - Swapped raw anchors/buttons for <x-button> while preserving semantics and actions (reload, back, navigate).

Expenses module standardization (new in this update):
- expenses/create.blade.php
  - Migrated to shared components: <x-form.input> (including textarea), <x-form.select>, and <x-form.checkbox>.
  - Preserved original names and IDs (amount, currency, expense_date, category, payment_method, expense_type, description, merchant, location, tags, notes, is_tax_deductible, is_recurring) to avoid breaking controllers/validation.
  - Replaced header/back and form action buttons with <x-button> (secondary for Cancel, primary for Create).
  - Kept help/error rendering through components and token-based focus/hover states.
- expenses/edit.blade.php
  - Standardized all inputs/selects to shared components with bound old()/model values.
  - Replaced checkboxes with <x-form.checkbox> and select fields with <x-form.select> for status and recurring schedule.

  - Maintained existing JS that toggles the recurring schedule section based on the checkbox state.
- expenses/index.blade.php
  - Replaced header CTA and filter actions with <x-button> for primary/secondary variants.

Utility Bills module form standardization (this update):
- utility-bills/create.blade.php
  - Migrated all text/number/date/select fields to shared components: <x-form.input>, <x-form.select>, and kept the Auto‑pay checkbox as <x-form.checkbox>.
  - Preserved all original field names and IDs (utility_type, service_provider, account_number, payment_status, service_address, bill_amount, currency, usage_amount, usage_unit, rate_per_unit, budget_alert_threshold, bill_period_start, bill_period_end, due_date, payment_date, service_plan, auto_pay_enabled, contract_terms, notes) to keep controllers/validation and any JS intact.
  - Form actions already used <x-button>; confirmed consistency and tokens for focus/hover in light/dark modes.
- utility-bills/edit.blade.php
  - Migrated all editable fields to shared components with proper old()/model bindings.
  - Reused <x-form.input> for date/number/text/textarea and <x-form.select> for selects; kept <x-form.checkbox> for Auto‑pay enabled.
  - Preserved routes, CSRF/method spoofing, and semantics; actions already used <x-button>.

Why this helps:
- Completes the Utility Bills module alignment with the JazeOS design system, ensuring consistent inputs, focus states, and dark mode, without altering behavior.

Subscriptions module form standardization (new in this pass):
- subscriptions/create.blade.php
  - Migrated the entire form to shared components: <x-form.input>, <x-form.select>, and <x-form.checkbox>.
  - Preserved all original field names and IDs (service_name, category, description, cost, currency, billing_cycle, billing_cycle_days, start_date, next_billing_date, payment_method, merchant_info, auto_renewal, cancellation_difficulty, tags, notes).
  - Kept existing JS behavior for the custom billing days (toggleCustomDays) by preserving element IDs and the onchange handler.
  - Header/back and form action buttons were already standardized to <x-button>; confirmed consistency.
  - Added helpful prefixes/helpText where appropriate (e.g., $ prefix on numeric currency fields).

- subscriptions/edit.blade.php (completed in this update)
  - Fully migrated to shared components across all sections: Basic Info, Billing Information, Important Dates, Payment Information, and Additional Information (Tags, Notes).
  - Replaced native checkbox with <x-form.checkbox> for Auto-renewal; converted selects/inputs to <x-form.select> and <x-form.input> and preserved IDs/names to keep controllers and JS intact.
  - Maintained the toggleCustomDays behavior (onchange on billing_cycle) and the billing_cycle_days field id for JS compatibility.
  - Simplified tags submission to a single comma-separated string; back-end can split if needed (IDs/names unchanged).

Why this helps:
- Continues the UI updates by moving a high-traffic form to the JazeOS shared components, ensuring consistent tokens, focus states, and dark mode without changing functionality.

Why it helps:
- Advances UI modernization by adopting shared JazeOS components for actions across Investments, ensuring consistent styling, focus states, and dark mode.
- Preserves existing semantics, routes, element names, IDs, and any JS behaviors (onclick/modal triggers).

Follow-ups for Investments:
- Consider migrating remaining raw inputs/selects in investments/create to <x-form.*> components in a subsequent pass (kept native in this update to minimize risk).
- Optionally convert the Tax Year selector on tax-reports/index to <x-form.select> with onchange, preserving behavior.

Formatting note:
- Please run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` locally to format updated Blade templates.

Component usage quick reference:
- Primary button: <x-button type="submit" variant="primary">Save</x-button>
- Secondary link-button: <x-button href="{{ route('dashboard') }}" variant="secondary">Back</x-button>
