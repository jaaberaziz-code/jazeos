name: expense-categorization
description: Maps merchants and text patterns to JazeOS expense categories. Used by the email-ingestion agent (and later the bank-statement processor) to assign a deterministic category instead of inventing one.
when_to_use: Triggered whenever an agent or assistant must assign an `expenses.create` payload's `category` and `subcategory` fields. Skip when the user has explicitly chosen a category in the source data.

# Expense categorization

Agents categorize expenses by walking the rule list below top to bottom and stopping at the first match. Match-patterns are case-insensitive substrings tested against the **merchant** field first, then the email **subject + body**. Add or remove rules as your spending changes.

If nothing matches, the agent assigns `category: "uncategorized"` and never invents a new top-level category. Add a rule rather than letting the agent guess.

## Categories

The canonical category values are listed here. These are what end up in the `expenses.category` field. Subcategories are optional but useful for analytics.

- **groceries** — `supermarket`, `convenience`, `farmers-market`, `butcher`, `bakery`
- **dining** — `restaurant`, `delivery`, `coffee`, `bar`, `fast-food`
- **transport** — `rideshare`, `taxi`, `fuel`, `public-transit`, `parking`, `tolls`, `car-service`
- **utilities** — `electricity`, `water`, `internet`, `mobile`, `heating`, `gas`, `waste`
- **subscriptions** — `streaming`, `news`, `cloud`, `dev-tools`, `saas`, `gym`
- **shopping** — `clothing`, `electronics`, `home`, `books`, `appliances`, `furniture`
- **health** — `pharmacy`, `doctor`, `dentist`, `optical`, `lab`, `therapy`
- **entertainment** — `cinema`, `concert`, `gaming`, `event`, `museum`
- **travel** — `flight`, `hotel`, `rental-car`, `accommodation`, `train`
- **education** — `course`, `book`, `tuition`, `certification`
- **insurance** — `health`, `car`, `home`, `life`
- **banking** — `fee`, `interest`, `transfer`
- **pets** — `food`, `vet`, `supplies`
- **personal-care** — `haircut`, `cosmetics`, `spa`
- **gifts** — `gift`
- **charity** — `donation`
- **taxes** — `vat`, `income-tax`, `property-tax`
- **household** — `cleaning`, `repairs`, `furnishings`
- **uncategorized** — fallback only

## Rules

Add merchant-specific rules near the top so they win over generic substring matches. Anything not on this list will fall through to `uncategorized`.

## Vendor aliases

Some payment processors / bank statements show a different merchant string than the receipt does. List `<alias> = <canonical>` so the rule list above stays clean. If you don't recognize a string, leave it for the human review queue rather than guessing.

```
# Examples — extend as you encounter them.
# anton d.o.o.        = lidl       # some Lidl stores are billed under their corporate entity
# tipo komerc         = tinex
# pp paypal           = paypal     # generic PayPal forwarder; downstream rule must categorize the underlying merchant
# google *youtube     = youtube premium
# apple.com/bill mac  = apple.com/bill
```

## Defaults

- If no rule matches, the agent uses `category = "uncategorized"`. The user re-categorizes from the dashboard, and a future rule should be added here.
- Receipts without a clear amount, date, or currency are skipped, never categorized.
- Currency is read from the receipt; if absent, the agent reports the receipt as a skip.
- Subcategory is optional; only emit one when the rule supplies it.
